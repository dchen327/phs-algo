 * Percolation. Given a composite system comprised of randomly distributed insulating
 *  and metallic materials: what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so
 *  that the composite system is an electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape 
 * with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water 
 * be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface)? 
 * Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such situations.
